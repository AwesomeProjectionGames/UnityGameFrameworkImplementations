# Unity Game Framework Implementations
A collection of systems that implement unified game interface from [Game Framework](https://github.com/AwesomeProjectionGames/GameFramework) in Unity.

## Modules implemented
- **BaseImplementation**: Core implementations of Game Framework interfaces for Unity, including base classes for actors, controllers, components, and other fundamental systems
  - Others systems can be used standalone without this package, but not the opposite.
- **Spectating**: A spectate system implementation for GameFramework. Provides controllers and components for managing spectating functionality (UIs elements of a certain actor) and camera management.
- **Spawn Point**: An implementation of Spawn Points using the Game Framework interfaces.
- **Effects**: Provides controllers and components for managing objects effects (gameplay / attributes) tied to actors and gameplay events.
- **Communications**: A package that provides common communication mechanisms for Unity Game Framework-based projects, including event buses and tools to facilitate inter-system communication and interfaces workflow in Unity.
